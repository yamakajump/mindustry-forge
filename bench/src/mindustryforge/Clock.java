/**
 * Controls how fast the simulation advances relative to wall-clock time.
 *
 * <p>Two independent mechanisms, which is what makes this work:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A fixed timestep, installed by swapping {@code Core.graphics} for a
 *       {@link FixedStepGraphics}. Every frame advances the world by the same amount of
 *       game time regardless of how long it really took.
 *   <li>A frame budget, set by writing {@code HeadlessApplication.renderInterval}. The
 *       headless loop sleeps until that interval has elapsed, so shrinking it runs more
 *       frames per second, and zero removes the sleep entirely.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Together they give clean acceleration: the world advances at a constant, reproducible
 * rate per frame, and the frames simply arrive faster. Deliberately not done by inflating
 * {@code Time.delta}, which would make units move further per step and let them tunnel
 * through walls, nor by running extra logic updates per frame, which would desynchronise
 * anything driven by frame counts.
 *
 * <p>Reflection is required because {@code renderInterval} has no setter. The field is
 * read fresh on every loop iteration, so writes take effect immediately.
