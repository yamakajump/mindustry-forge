/**

 * <p>The contract an environment needs is that the world does not move while the agent is
 * choosing. Otherwise the state an action was chosen for is already stale when the action
 * lands, and nothing is reproducible.
 *
 * <p>That is achieved by pausing rather than by blocking. After each observation the game
 * state is set to paused, which makes {@code Logic.update} skip the world entirely, and a
 * step request unpauses it for a fixed number of ticks. No thread is ever held, so the
 * server stays responsive and the console keeps working while an agent thinks.
 *
 * <p>A step spans several ticks on purpose. Deciding 60 times per game second is pointless
 * for a game about building factories, and it would multiply the cost of every observation
 * by an order of magnitude for no gain in control.
